Next to do:

Priority:
* Add new apis, to link some of the current statistic components, as currently some of them are using static data
* Add validations to habit add
* Revamp the UI interfaces especially in dueHabits, and habits (consider using a table, with an option to view a specific habit card using dialog, and add pagination)
* Clean up the UI Code (Quite messy), can split it into more reusable components
* Add a fallback page, incase of invalid URL by user
* Update the dtos in to conform to a more consistent response structure, currently its pretty plain and has no metadata.
